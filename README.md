# Deploy Request Examples

## Getting Started

This repository contains example projects to help you get started with making a contract deploy request to your project on Loki.code.

Start by accessing the folder that fits your preferred framework, and then follow the instructions within its README.

- [Hardhat example project](/hardhat/)
- [Foundry example project](/foundry/)

If you just want to quickly access the example deploy request script itself instead, choose

- [Hardhat example script](/hardhat/scripts/deploy-request.ts)
- [Foundry example script](/foundry/script/deploy-request.sh)
